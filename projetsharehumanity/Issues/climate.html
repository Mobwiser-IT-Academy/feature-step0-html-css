                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        Global warming is a global phenomenon of climate transformation characterized by a general increase in average temperatures (in particular linked to human activities), and which permanently modifies meteorological balances and ecosystems. <br>
                    </p>
                    <h3><strong>Causes</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        Human activities such as the use of fossil fuels, logging and ranching of livestock exert an increasing influence on the climate and temperature of the earth. These activities release huge amounts of greenhouse gases, which are added to those naturally present in the atmosphere, thus reinforcing the greenhouse effect and global warming.<br> 
                        <h4><strong>Greenhouse-effect gas</strong></h4> 
                        The main driver of climate change is the greenhouse effect. Some gases in the Earth's atmosphere act like the walls of a greenhouse: they allow solar energy to enter the atmosphere but prevent it from escaping, causing global warming.
                        Many of these greenhouse gases are naturally present in the atmosphere, but human activity increases the concentrations of some of them, in particular:
                        <ul>
                            <li>carbon dioxide (CO2)</li>
                            <li>methane</li>   
                            <li>nitrous oxide</li>
                            <li>fluorinated gases</li>  
                        </ul>
                        The CO2 produced by human activities is the main contributor to global warming. By 2020, its concentration in the atmosphere had risen to 48% above its pre-industrial level (before 1750).
                        <br>
                        <h4>The causes of the increase in emissions</h4>
                        The combustion of coal, oil and gas produces carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. <br> The disappearance of forests (deforestation), because trees help to regulate the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. When they are felled, this positive effect is lost and the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere, worsening the greenhouse effect.
                        The increase in animal husbandry, as cattle and sheep produce large amounts of methane when they digest their food.
                        Fertilizers containing nitrogen produce emissions of nitrous oxyde.
                        Fluorinated gases are emitted by equipment and products that use these gases. These emissions have a considerable warming effect, up to 23,000 times that of CO2.
                    </p>
                    <h3><strong>The effects of climate change</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        Climate change affects all regions of the world. Polar ice caps are melting and ocean levels are rising. In some regions, extreme weather events and precipitation are increasingly frequent, while others face increasingly extreme heat waves and droughts.
                        <br> These effects are expected to intensify over the coming decades. 
                        <h4><strong>Melting ice and rising sea levels</strong></h4>
                        The warming of the water causes it to expand. At the same time, global warming is causing glaciers and polar ice caps to melt. <br> The combination of these changes causes ocean levels to rise, leading to flooding and erosion of coastal areas and others at lower elevations.
                        Extreme weather conditions and changes in precipitation.
                        Heavy precipitation and other extreme weather events are increasingly common. They can cause flooding and adversely affect water quality, but also reduce the availability of water resources in some areas.
                        <h4><strong>Consequences for developing countries</strong></h4>
                        Many poor developing countries are among the most affected. Often, the people who live there depend heavily on their natural environment, even though it is they who have the least resources to cope with climate change.
                        <h4><strong>Risks to human health</strong></h4>
                        Climate change is already having an impact on health: the number of heat-related deaths has increased in some regions, while a decrease in cold-related deaths has been seen in others;
                        we are already seeing changes in the distribution of some waterborne diseases and some disease vectors. <br>
                        Costs to society and the economy Damage to property and infrastructure and the effects on human health entail considerable costs to society and the economy.Between 1980 and 2011, the floods affected more than 5.5 million people and caused direct economic losses amounting to more than 90 billion euros. Sectors that are highly dependent on temperature and rainfall, such as agriculture, forestry, energy and tourism, are particularly affected.
                        <h4><strong>Consequences for wildlife</strong></h4>
                        Climate change is so rapid that many plants and animal species have had difficulty adapting to it. Many terrestrial, freshwater and marine species have already moved to new territories. Some plant and animal species will be seriously threatened with extinction if the average temperature of the planet continues to rise uncontrollably.
